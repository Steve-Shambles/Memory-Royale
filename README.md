Memory Royale is a simple memory matching game.

To start a game click on any card, and that card will be revealed.

Your task is to find a matching card by clicking on another card.

At first you will have to guess where the matching card is at random.

If you find a matching pair, then those two cards will stay revealed on the board.

If you do not find a match, both cards are covered again and it is your job to try and remember what cards are where so that you can find all of the matching pairs.

You must also complete this task within a set amount of attempts, 'clicks'.

On level 1 you have 30 clicks to find all 8 matching pairs.
On level 2 you have 60 clicks and level 3, 90 clicks.

If you succeed in finding all the pairs inside the set amount of clicks then you will progress to the next level.

That's about all there is to know.

This one keeps your brain sharp, believe me!.
Enjoy.
